    "- Port\n",
    "- ComponentReference\n",
    "- ComponentReferences\n",

    "Note the migration changes:\n",
    "- `port.dangle` has been renamed to `port.orientation`\n",
    "    - `port.angle` represents the angle 90 degrees multiples.\n",
    "    - `port.orientation` represents the angle in degrees.\n",
    "- `CHECK_INSTANCES` has been renamed to `CheckInstances`\n",
    "    - Most often used in the `@cell` decorator.\n",
    "- `Port(..., layer: tuple[int, int])` has been replaced with `Port(..., layer: int)`\n",
    "    - `layer` now represents the layer index in the KLayout layer stack.\n",
    "    - To update your code you can do `Port(..., layer=gf.kcl.layout.layer(*layer))`\n",
    "    - We also recommend just using Component.add_port, with which you can specify the layer as tuple.\n",
    "- Most of the `d` prefix attributes and functions can now be used without the `d` prefix.\n",
    "- `ComponentReference.parent` has been removed, you should use `ComponentReference.cell` instead.\n",
    "- `ComponentReference.info` has been removed, you should use `ComponentReference.cell.info` instead."
